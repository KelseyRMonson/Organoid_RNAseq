Results from initial pilot project, with RNA-seq alignment and quantification performed on `20 May 2025`.

## Experiment Details
- **Samples**
  - `Sample 1` Wild-type (pre-Cre) for P53 mutant endometrial cancer (??)
  - `Sample 2` Mutant (plus-Cre) P53 endometrial cancer (??)
- **Timeframe**
  -   RNA isolated and sent for sequencing on `10 April 2025`
  -   Sequencing returned `29 April 2025` (KM received download link `01 May 2025`)
  -   Nextflow [NF-Core RNA-seq](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq) pipeline run `20 May 2025`
