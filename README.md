# Konrad's Organoid RNA-seq
Repo for housing the results from the RNA-seq of organoids from Konrad's thesis project.

Currently, this houses the results from the pilot experiment:
- **Samples**
  - Species: Mouse (Mus musculus)
  - `Sample 1` Wild-type (pre-Cre) for P53 mutant endometrial cancer (??)
  - `Sample 2` Mutant (plus-Cre) P53 endometrial cancer (??)
- **Timeframe**
  -   RNA isolated and sent for sequencing on `10 April 2025`
  -   Sequencing returned `29 April 2025` (KM received download link `01 May 2025`)
  -   Nextflow [NF-Core RNA-seq](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq) pipeline run `20 May 2025`
  -   *Next up*: KM to complete EdgeR analysis in R
